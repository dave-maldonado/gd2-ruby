Ruby/GD2 - Ruby binding for Thomas Boutell's gd 2.x graphics library

Robert wrote this Ruby library because he wasn't satisfied with the existing
Ruby/GD extension library. Among other things, it had no support for
creating images from PNG or JPEG data already in memory. Jonas migrated the
library glue from DL to FFI since A) it crashed on Windows and B) DL doesn't 
work well in jRuby.

Ruby/GD2 is 100% Ruby and uses FFI to link with the gd shared library. Most
of the gd API is supported in some way, however the interface is quite
different so that we can do things The Ruby Way as much as possible.

Most of the documentation for this library is now in RDoc form.
